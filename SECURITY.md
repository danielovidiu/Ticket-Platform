# Security & Compliance

How authentication, payments, and personal-data handling work in this platform, and
what each piece guarantees. Env var reference lives in `backend/.env.example`.

## Authentication

Three sign-in methods, all issuing the same first-party opaque session cookie:

- **Email + password** — bcrypt (cost 12). Registration requires ToS acceptance and an
  8-char minimum. Login returns an identical generic `401` for a missing user, an
  OAuth-only account, or a wrong password, and runs a dummy bcrypt verify on the
  missing-user path to flatten timing (a mitigation, not a guarantee of full
  enumeration resistance).
- **Google** — our own OAuth client (server-side code exchange). `state` CSRF cookie;
  `id_token` verified against Google's JWKS.
- **Apple** — `form_post` callback; `id_token` verified against Apple's JWKS. Name/email
  and any private-relay address are captured only on the first authorization (Apple
  sends them once). Requires a public HTTPS callback — not testable on localhost.

**Account linking (verified-email gate).** OAuth logins match by provider `sub` first,
then by email. Email-based auto-linking happens **only** if the existing account's email
is already verified, or the incoming provider asserts the email is verified. Otherwise
the flow is refused with a "use your original method" message — this closes the
pre-registration account-takeover hole that silent merge-by-email would open.

### Sessions & cookies

- `session_token`: opaque 256-bit random, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`+`SameSite=None` on HTTPS
  (or `Lax`+insecure on http dev, derived from `PUBLIC_APP_URL`), 7-day lifetime.
- Rotated on every login (old token deleted) — defeats fixation.
- Stored with a real `expires_at` datetime and reaped by a MongoDB **TTL index**
  (`expireAfterSeconds=0`). The TTL monitor is best-effort (~60s); `get_current_user`
  also checks expiry explicitly, which is the real guard.
- Password reset performs a **global logout** (deletes all of the user's sessions).

### Signed tokens (`backend/server.py: make_token/read_token`)

JWT HS256 signed with `SESSION_SECRET`, each purpose scoped by a distinct `aud` so a
token from one flow can't be replayed against another:

| Purpose        | TTL     | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| `email-verify` | 24h     | |
| `pwd-reset`    | 1h      | Single-use: bound to the current password-hash tail |
| `news-confirm` | 7d      | Double opt-in |
| `news-unsub`   | 365d    | One-click unsubscribe; idempotent |

## Payments & fulfillment

- Two modes (`PAYMENTS_MODE`): **fake** (default, no Stripe account — full local
  simulation) and **stripe** (real SDK, requires `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
- Webhooks verify the Stripe signature via `Webhook.construct_event`; a bad/absent
  signature is `400`.
- **Idempotency**: each processed event id is inserted into `processed_stripe_events`
  (unique index); replays are no-ops, so a webhook + status-poll race can't double-issue
  tickets. `_finalize_paid_reservation` is itself idempotent (guarded pending→paid).
- Ticket-delivery email (with QR attachments) is transactional and best-effort — a mail
  failure is logged and never rolls back a paid order.

## Consent & marketing (GDPR / CAN-SPAM)

- Opt-ins (`email_opt_in`, `news_opt_in`, `promo_opt_in`) default **off**. Every change
  — at registration, OAuth first login, or in settings — is written to `consent_log`
  with timestamp, IP, policy version, and source.
- Newsletter uses **double opt-in** (nothing is "subscribed" until the emailed confirm
  link is clicked) and provides a one-click unsubscribe plus a `List-Unsubscribe` header.
- No third-party analytics. The former PostHog/session-recording snippet (which used an
  Emergent-owned key) has been removed. Any future analytics must be gated behind the
  `CookieConsent` opt-in, not fired on load.
- CSV export uses the stdlib writer and neutralizes spreadsheet formula injection.

## Data-subject rights

- **Export** (`GET /auth/export`): machine-readable JSON of the user's account,
  reservations, tickets, invoices, payments, consent log, session metadata, and
  newsletter status.
- **Deletion** (`DELETE /auth/account`): anonymize-in-place, not hard delete. Email is
  scrubbed to `deleted+<id>@anon.invalid`, name/phone/picture blanked, and
  `password_hash`/`google_sub`/`apple_sub` unset; all sessions killed; newsletter
  unsubscribed. **Invoices and tickets are retained** (with the now-anonymized user
  reference) for fiscal/audit obligations. The last remaining admin cannot delete
  themselves.
- **Audit log** (`audit_log`): role changes, refunds, event cancel/delete, newsletter
  deletes, and account deletions.

## Retention

| Data | Retention |
|------|-----------|
| Invoices / tickets | ~10 years (Romanian fiscal law) — kept through account deletion, anonymized |
| Sessions | 7 days (TTL) |
| Consent log / audit log | Indefinite (compliance evidence) |

## Out of scope for code (operational follow-ups)

A written Privacy Policy + Terms of Service (the UI links to `/privacy` and `/terms`),
a cookie/subprocessor list, signed DPAs with each subprocessor (Stripe, Resend, Google,
Apple, the Mongo host), and a breach-notification runbook. The code provides the
mechanisms; these documents and agreements must be supplied operationally.
